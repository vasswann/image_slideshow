# image_slideshow
This is a vanilla JavaScript and CSS animation image slider.
The images get rendered with javascript to the DOM. I store them in an array. Then loop trough. Now the hard part was I have 3 images. 
So when one move out from the place, the other one need to replace. I am a junior developer, and just was for fun practicing. I am sure 
there is a better way to build this. Thank you. Have fun
